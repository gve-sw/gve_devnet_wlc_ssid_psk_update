# GVE Devnet WLC SSID PSK Update


This prototype updates the Pre-Shared-Key PSK for specific SSIDs on Cisco Cat9800 and AireOS controllers. The PSK is generated by a Python script and sent to the specified email addresses via SMTP. A cron job is then configured to automatically schedule the process.

## Installation/Configuration

The following commands are executed in the terminal.

1. Set up a Python virtual environment. Make sure Python 3 is installed in your environment, and if not, you may download Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). 
Once Python 3 is installed in your environment, you can activate the virtual environment with the instructions found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html). 

2. Access the created virtual environment folder

        $ cd your_venv

3. Clone this repository

        $ git clone https://wwwin-github.cisco.com/gve/gve_devnet_wlc_ssid_psk_update.git


4. Access the folder `gve_devnet_wlc_ssid_psk_update`

        $ cd gve_devnet_wlc_ssid_psk_update

5. Install the dependencies:

        $ pip install -r requirements.txt

6. In `.env`, fill out the controllers-related and SMTP-related credentials:

```
cat_host=
cat_username=
cat_password=

smtp_sender=
smtp_server=

aireos_host=
aireos_username=
aireos_password=

```
## Usage
1. To test the prototype for the Catalyst 9800 WLC, open the update_psk_cat.py file and fill out the SSIDs and email addresses in the following format: 

         SSIDs = [ ["ssid name","email1","email2"] ]

Then run the file with following command:

        $ python3 update_psk_cat.py

2. To test the prototype for the AireOS WLC, open the update_psk_aireos.py file and fill out the WLANs and email addresses in the following format: 

         WLANs = [ ["wlanId","email1","email2"] ]

Then run the file with following command:


        $ python3 update_psk_aireos.py

3. Once testing is done, you can use a Linux Cron job to automate the psk update process to run every week.
